# Okta Spring Security & Okta-Hosted Login Page Example

This example shows you how to use the [Okta Spring Boot Library][] to login a user.  The login is achieved through the [Authorization Code Flow][] where the user is redirected to the Okta-Hosted login page.  After the user authenticates, they are redirected back to the application and a local cookie session is created.

## Prerequisites

Before running this sample, you will need the following:

* [Java 11+](https://sdkman.io/jdks)
* [The Okta CLI Tool](https://github.com/okta/okta-cli/#installation)
* An Okta Developer Account, create one using `okta register`, or configure an existing one with `okta login`

## Get the Code

Grab and configure this project using `okta start spring-boot`

## Run the Example

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
